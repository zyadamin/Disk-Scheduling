# Disk-Scheduling
You should try to compare the output after applying all the following disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK) as well as the newly optimized algorithm
by implementing their algorithms and applying it on a disk queue with requests for I/O blocks on cylinders.
Example of cylinders I/O requests:
98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
Initial head start cylinder: 53
The newly optimized algorithm procedure and flowchart are found in page 10 in the following paper:
